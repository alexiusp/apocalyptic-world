As you push through the flap of the makeshift hospital tent, the stark contrast between the chaos outside and the relative calm within strikes you immediately. 
The dim lighting from a few strategically placed lanterns casts long shadows on the walls.
<br /><br />
<<=setup.displayName(_npc)>>, in white coat stained and worn, notices you as soon as you step inside. 
<<=_pronWhos>> eyes narrow in concern as <<=_pronWhat>> spots the blood seeping through your clothes.
<br /><br />
<<sayNpc _npc>>
    You're bleeding! We need to take care of that immediately. Please, lay down on this bed.
<</sayNpc>>
<br />
As <<=_pronWhat>> works, <<=_pronWhos>> hands are gentle yet efficient. <<=setup.pronounceWhat(_npc, true)>> cleans the wound with a practiced ease, applying a disinfectant that stings sharply. 
<br /><br />
<<sayNpc _npc>>
    You're lucky you came in when you did. Out here, infections can be just as deadly as the injuries themselves.

    As she cleans up the last of her supplies, you notice her eyes flicker to your crotch a few times, though she quickly averts her gaze each time. 
    Despite her obvious professionalism, there's a momentary flicker of curiosity or perhaps concern in her expression.

        Without warning, she slides her hand under the sheet, her fingers brushing lightly against your dick as she grabs it and strats to stroke it. 
        Her touch is gentle, almost soothing, but there's an undeniable tension in the air.
