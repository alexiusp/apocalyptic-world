<h1 class="ptitle">NEGAN'S OFFICE</h1>
<br />
Negan, seated at his makeshift desk, looks up as the newcomers enter. 
His keen eyes assess the group, noting their worn-out clothes and exhaustion.

<<set _npc2 = setup.companionGet(_girls[1])>>
<<negan>>
    Oh, what we got here.
<</negan>>
<br /><br />
Negan rises from his chair. He keenly observes each girl, gauging their demeanor and intentions in this unforgiving world.<br />
After that he goes back to his desk, opens drawer and takes out ropes and rope gags. Goes back to the girls and starts to tie them up.
